# LLM Function Calling

Welcome to the LLM Function Calling repository, where we explore and demonstrate the functional calling capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that showcase how to build applications using LLMs' advanced features.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the functional calling capabilities of LLMs, which allow developers to invoke specific functions within the model to perform tasks such as generating streaming outputs, handling complex queries, and structuring data.

## Notebooks

- `streaming_output.ipynb`: Demonstrates how to generate streaming outputs from an LLM, useful for real-time applications.
- `phi-3.ipynb`: Shows how to utilize the 'phi-3' function of an LLM for advanced query resolution.
- `structure_output.ipynb`: Provides examples of structuring the output from an LLM, making it easier to parse and utilize in applications.

## Getting Started

To use these notebooks:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed. If not, install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imanoop7/llm-function-calling.git
3. Navigate to the cloned directory and start Jupyter:
   cd llm-function-calling
   jupyter notebook
4. Open the desired notebook and follow the instructions within to start utilizing the LLMâ€™s functional calling capabilities.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
